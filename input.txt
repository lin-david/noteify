Bears have fascinated us for centuries. As one of the most adaptable and versatile mammals on earth, their behavior stirs fear, awe, wonder and curiosity in us. Unfortunately, there are still many myths surrounding the lives and behavior of bears which impact on people's imagination negatively. Stories of ferocious attacks by blood-thirsty bears on defenceless hikers, of irrational and spiteful attacks on campers, and so forth, are often economical with the truth when it comes to explaining why these attacks took place and whether they were even provoked, directly or indirectly. The overwhelming sense conveyed in these stories is that bears are dangerous, mean creatures that are an extreme threat to people in any circumstance. Of course this is inaccurate at best, and unhelpful at worst.
