#Hi, this is Noteify!
#Save precious study seconds by making your text do all the work.

#This web app optimizes reading efficiency and study recall by analyzing input text for significance on a word-by-word basis. Words are evaluated based on their frequency in the English language, and consequently assigned a score. More uncommon words are then blown up in physical text size to make them stand out, while more common words remain smaller.
